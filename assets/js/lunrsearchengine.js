But to reap the rewards, you need to be able to analyze large amounts of unstructured text. Text mining is an essential skill for anyone working in big data and data science. This course teaches text-mining techniques to extract, cleanse, and process text using Python and the scikit-learn and nltk libraries. Our Indian instructor explains how to perform text analytics using popular techniques like word cloud and sentiment analysis. He then shows how to make predictions with text data using clustering, classification, and recommendations—otherwise known as predictive text. Along the way, he introduces important text analytics concepts such as lemmatization and n-grams. "

She helps you learn the concepts behind how recommendation systems work by taking you through a series of examples and exercises. Once you’re familiar with the underlying concepts, Lillian explains how to apply statistical and machine learning methods to construct your own recommenders. She demonstrates how to build a popularity-based recommender using the Pandas library, how to recommend similar items based on correlation, and how to deploy various machine learning algorithms to make recommendations. At the end of the course, she shows how to evaluate which recommender performed the best. "
