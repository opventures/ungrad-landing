You can quickly increase or decrease capacity as your requirements change—only paying for the capacity you need now. In this course, instructor Shyam Raj helps you deepen your understanding of Amazon EC2. Learn how to attach Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes to your instances and enable features such as encryption and snapshots, which help you back up the data on your volumes. Shyam also provides coverage of Amazon Machine Images (AMI) and explores the key features, working mechanism, and use cases for T2 and T3 instances. Plus, discover the options for Amazon EC2 networking and explore purchasing options, such as on-demand versus reserved and spot instances, that help you maximize your budget without sacrificing power.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sal</name></author><category term="Amazon EC2" /><category term="DevOps" /><category term="Backend" /><category term="backend" /><category term="devops" /><summary type="html">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

  &lt;p&gt;Python for Data Science Essential Training is one of the most popular data science courses at UnGrad Learning. It has now been updated and expanded to two parts—for even more hands-on experience with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this course, instructor takes you step by step through a practical data science project: a web scraper that downloads and analyzes data from the web. Along the way, she introduces techniques to clean, reformat, transform, and describe raw data; generate visualizations; remove outliers; perform simple data analysis; and generate interactive graphs using the Plotly library. You should walk away from this training with basic coding experience that you can take to your organization and quickly apply to your own custom data science projects..&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sal</name></author><category term="Data Science" /><category term="Machine Learning" /><category term="Python" /><category term="data science" /><category term="python" /><summary type="html">Python for Data Science Essential Training is one of the most popular data science courses at UnGrad Learning.

She helps you learn the concepts behind how recommendation systems work by taking you through a series of examples and exercises. Once you’re familiar with the underlying concepts, Lillian explains how to apply statistical and machine learning methods to construct your own recommenders. She demonstrates how to build a popularity-based recommender using the Pandas library, how to recommend similar items based on correlation, and how to deploy various machine learning algorithms to make recommendations.
